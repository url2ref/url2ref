## Motivation

Citing a news article on the web can be a tedious process. While tools exist for converting a collection of attributes into a specific reference style, it remains a chore to collect those attributes and type them into the tool. This application aims to make this process automatic for web resources which have annotated their content using the [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) or the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary.
